# new (dev) hires onboarding

Onboarding new hires is a very important process in any company. It's the first impression that the new hire gets from the company and it's the first impression that the company gets from the new hire. It's also a very important process for the new hire to get to know the company and the people in it.

## What is happening today?

Today, the onboarding usually involves some documentation and some meetings with the team. Most of the time, the new hire is left alone to read the documentation and try to understand the company's processes and tools. This is a very time consuming process and it's not very effective. The new hire is usually left with a lot of questions and it's hard to get answers to them.

## What can we do better?
Use CoCMD. CoCMD is a tool for keeping Command line shortcuts, sequences and knowhows ** AS CODE **. This means that you can easily share your knowledge with your team and community. And ofcourse, create your ** onboarding ** package and share it with your new hires.
