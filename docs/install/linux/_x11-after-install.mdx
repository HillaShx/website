From now on, you should have the `cocmd` command available in the terminal (you can verify by running `cocmd --version`).

At this point, you are ready to use cocmd by registering it first as a Systemd service and then starting it with:

```bash
# Register cocmd as a systemd service (required only once)
cocmd service register

# Start cocmd
cocmd start
```

> If you don't want to use cocmd as a Systemd service, you can also start it in unmanaged mode with `cocmd start --unmanaged`. Keep in mind that Cocmd will not start automatically when running in unmanaged mode, so you will need to do so manually.

You are now ready to read the [Getting Started](../../get-started) tutorial!
